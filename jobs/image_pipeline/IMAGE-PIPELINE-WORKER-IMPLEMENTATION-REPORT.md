# Worker implementation handoff — `oglasino-image-worker`

**Status:** Worker code, tests, and CI/CD complete. Two deploys triggered (main → production, stage → stage) but **not yet verified by me** — you/orchestrator should check Actions output and run smoke tests.

**Repo:** `https://github.com/memento-tech/oglasino-image-worker`
**Local path:** `/Users/igorstojanovic/Desktop/projects/Oglasino/oglasino-image-worker`

## What was built

Cloudflare Worker per the locked contract in `jobs/image_pipeline/IMAGE-PIPELINE-WORKER-CONTRACT.md`. TypeScript strict-mode (every guardrail flag on, including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`). All 62 Vitest tests pass; `tsc --noEmit` clean.

### JWT verification (contract §5)

- HS256 only. Issuer enforced as `oglasino-backend`.
- `JWT_SIGNING_SECRET` tried first; falls back to `JWT_SIGNING_SECRET_PREVIOUS` ONLY on signature failure (not on expiry/issuer/scope errors).
- Distinct error codes: `TOKEN_EXPIRED`, `TOKEN_SIGNATURE_INVALID`, `TOKEN_ISSUER_INVALID`, `TOKEN_SCOPE_MISMATCH`, `TOKEN_KEY_MISMATCH`, `TOKEN_MALFORMED`.
- Claims sanity-checked beyond signature (upload tokens require `key`/`contentType`/`maxBytes`; view tokens require `keyPrefix`/`chatId`).

### CORS (contract §9)

- Allowlist parsed from `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var.
- Vercel preview suffix match: `https://oglasino-web-<alphanum>.vercel.app`.
- `Vary: Origin` on every CORS-affected response. Never echoes `*`.
- Allow-Credentials: false (header omitted).
- Preflight cache `Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400`.

### Logging (contract §10)

- Structured JSON to `console.log(JSON.stringify(...))`.
- Levels per §10.3: WARN for signature/scope/key/path-traversal failures, ERROR for R2 failures, INFO otherwise. Public GETs not logged (intentionally per §10.3).
- `x-request-id` generated (UUID v4) if not supplied; echoed in every response and every log line.

## Environment model & deployment

Two environments, no "dev" environment.

| Env        | Worker                    | Custom domain              | R2 bucket                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| stage      | `oglasino-images-stage`   | `cdn-staging.oglasino.com` | `oglasino-images-stage`   |
| production | `oglasino-images-prod`    | `cdn.oglasino.com`         | `oglasino-images-prod`    |

Top-level `wrangler.toml` mirrors stage — `wrangler deploy` without `--env` never hits production.

### Branch → environment mapping

- `stage` → stage (auto-deploy via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- `main` → production (auto-deploy)
- Manual `workflow_dispatch` with environment selector also available

### Required GH Actions repository secrets (already configured by Igor)

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` — Cloudflare API token (Workers + R2 + Routes scopes)
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `JWT_SIGNING_SECRET_STAGE` / `JWT_SIGNING_SECRET_PROD`
- `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET_STAGE` / `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET_PROD`

The deploy workflow uses `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3` `secrets:` input to push these to the Worker via `wrangler secret put` on every deploy. **Worker secrets are NOT pre-configured; they live as GH secrets and are pushed at deploy time.**

`JWT_SIGNING_SECRET_PREVIOUS` is intentionally NOT configured — added on first rotation only.

---

## Tests (62 passing)

Coverage:

- **JWT** (12 tests): valid, expired, wrong signature, wrong issuer, wrong scope (cross-scope), malformed, missing claims, dual-secret fallback success + failure.
- **Path validation** (13 tests): `..`, percent-encoded `..`, backslash, double-slash, single-dot segment, empty key, excessively long key, forbidden chars, visibility classifier.
- **CORS** (7 tests): allowed origin echoed, disallowed not echoed, Vercel preview suffix accepted, attacker preview rejected, no `*`, x-request-id minted/echoed.
- **Upload** (10 tests): happy path + each error code (`TOKEN_MISSING`, `PATH_TRAVERSAL`, `TOKEN_KEY_MISMATCH`, `CONTENT_TYPE_MISMATCH`, `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `CONTENT_TYPE_NOT_ALLOWED`, `TOKEN_EXPIRED`, `TOKEN_SIGNATURE_INVALID`) + idempotent retry verifying ETag stable on the second PUT.
- **View** (13 tests): public 200/404, private 200/400/401/403/404, key prefix mismatch, HEAD with no body, method-not-allowed (POST/DELETE 405).
- **Admin auth** (7 tests): missing/wrong/correct header, timingSafeEqual.

Run with `npm test`; lint with `npm run lint`.

## Decisions / deviations

1. **No Worker-level rate limiting in v1** (per WORKER_PROMPT decision).

   - Backend already gates issuance via Bucket4j (60/min/user, contract §11.4); upload JWTs are short-TTL and bound to a single key+content-type+maxBytes.
   - `lib/rateLimit.ts` is a stub returning `ok` always, with the call sites already plumbed (`jti`, `ip` available). Adding KV/Durable Object backing later is non-breaking.
   - Documented in README "Known gaps".

2. **No magic-byte content-type sniffing** — deferred per contract §13.4. Worker trusts the `Content-Type` header against the JWT `contentType` claim.

3. **Path traversal at the dispatch layer** — the WHATWG URL parser used by Workers normalizes `..`, `%2e%2e`, and `\` away before the Worker sees them. `validateKey` still rejects these inputs (defense-in-depth, covered by unit tests against the validator directly), but the realistic attack vector at the dispatch layer is forbidden characters (e.g. spaces becoming `%20`), which the validator rejects.

4. **No PR for review** — user opted at the end to push directly to `main` and `stage` rather than do PR review.

5. **`worker.js` (legacy) deleted** — was never tracked in this repo's history.

## What backend agent should rely on

- **Endpoints** are exactly the three listed above. PUT key matches JWT `key` claim **byte-for-byte** (contract §4.1 step 6); backend signs with the full key including prefix.
- **JWT structure** matches §5.1 (upload) and §5.2 (view) exactly. `iss` MUST be `"oglasino-backend"`. Worker rejects others with `TOKEN_ISSUER_INVALID`.
- **`JWT_SIGNING_SECRET` must be byte-identical between Worker and backend** for each environment. Provisioned via the GH Actions secret pair (`_STAGE`, `_PROD`); backend must use the matching value.
- **`maxBytes` claim** is per-token, capped by the Worker's `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` env (10 MB default). Backend can issue smaller per-scope limits.
- **`x-request-id`** is echoed in every Worker response (header). Backend should capture it on outgoing Worker calls and put it in MDC alongside backend's own request id.

---

## What frontend agent should rely on

- **Public URLs:** `https://cdn.oglasino.com/{key}` (Image Resizing variants via `/cdn-cgi/image/...` work transparently; Worker doesn't see those requests).
- **Private URLs:** `https://cdn.oglasino.com/{key}?token={view-jwt}`. Token is URL-safe base64 from `jose`; URL-encode if you're paranoid (single-call endpoints are fine without).
- **CORS allowlist** is configured for `oglasino.com`, `www.oglasino.com`, `oglasino-web.vercel.app`, Vercel preview suffix `oglasino-web-*.vercel.app`, and `localhost:3000` / `localhost:3001` in stage only. Production strips localhost.
- **Error responses** always have `{error: {code, message, details?, retryable}}` JSON. The `code` is stable; localize on it.

## What did NOT happen

- I did not run `wrangler deploy` myself — CI does that on push.
- I did not verify the deployed Worker responds correctly. The deploys were triggered by the pushes; success/failure is visible in GH Actions.
- I did not run any post-deploy smoke tests against the live URLs.
- I did not open a GitHub PR (no `gh` CLI available, and the user later opted to push directly to `main` + `dev` instead).
- I did not bind custom domains, create R2 buckets, or configure any GH secrets — Igor did all of that.
- I did not implement React Native, frontend, or backend changes — those are separate tracks per contract §17.
